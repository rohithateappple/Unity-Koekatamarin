# Unity-Koekatamarin

## About

This is a real-time speech to text gadget inspired by ome of my favorite anime, Doraemon. In this show there's a gadget called Koekatamarin, which is a potion like gadget that when consumed grants the user the ability to literally speak words into existence! As a kid, I always found this idea to be quiet unique so after 8 years, I've finally made one for myself.
