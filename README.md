# Unity-Koekatamarin

## About

This is a real-time speech to text gadget inspired by one of my favorite anime, Doraemon. In this show there's a gadget called Koekatamarin, which is a potion like gadget that when consumed grants the user the ability to literally speak words into existence! As a kid, I always found this idea to be quiet unique so after 8 years, I've finally made one for myself.

## Blueprint

So essentially how this programs works is pretty simple, we just convert speech to text in real-time and then add a dimensional quality to the string. Real-Time transcription is essentially so I setted with Google Cloud Services. And it works pretty well!
