Yosh, so you finally downloaded my little speech gadget experiment? And you're ready to try out my DIY Koekatamarin for yourself?
Unfortunately I'll have to stop your excitement just for a second. If you're here from my YouTube video, you might be aware of the
fact that I use Google Cloud Services for speech transcription. The problem is that it isn't FREE! As much as I'd love to keep this an open and close package, you will have to do something on your own for this to work. 

Don't worry, I'm here to guide you. The only thing you need to take care of is the Google Speech To Text API service key. Like I said, I am using a free tier which you get once you sign up. I personally got $300 worth of free transcription but even if you don't get that, you can still use the free free tier for a certain word limit. I think that's more than enough to test out this gadget :)

It can be daunting to setup the Google Cloud Services, so go watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaAB9ogyB-U&t=35s Watch only till 1:24 and obviously change text to speech to speech to text.

So once you've signed up and have a project and service key in hand, paste that service key inside this path (in this folder): Google Speech Transcriber\Debug\net6.0

Also, just a recommendation - make sure you use a good quality mic. It could be your laptop mic, a dedicated mic or a headphone mic.
Just make sure it has good quality. This is nit picking, because I tried this on my laptop mic (which is terrible) and Google still
managed to get 6/10 words correct. Only catch, I had to scream at the top of my lungs.

Once thats done, you're all set to go! Happy speaking to yourself and people calling you a clown. Hahaha. nvm.
